# library-odin
Library project done for The Odin Project using vanilla HTML/CSS/Javascript

Please disregard the aesthetics, the focus of this project was 100% functionality. The layout is not designed responsive so this may not work properly on mobile. You can add books, delete them or toggle whether you have read them or not.
